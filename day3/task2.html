<body><h1>Makar Sankrati</h1>
   <p> <b>Makar(a) Sankranti</b> ( <a href="#">Sanskrit</a>: मकरसङ्क्रान्ति, <a href="#">romanized</a> : <i>Makarasaṅkrānti</i> ),[1] (transl. Capricorn Festival) also referred to as <b>Uttarayana, Makar</b>, or simply <b>Sankranti</b>, is a <a href="#">Hindu</a> observance and a festival. Usually falling on the date of 14 January annually (15 January on a leap year), <sup>[2][3][4]</sup> this occasion marks the transition of the sun from the zodiac of Sagittarius (dhanu) to Capricorn (makara).[2][5][6] Since the sun has made this transition which vaguely coincides with moving from south to north, the festival is dedicated to the solar deity, Surya,[7] and is observed to mark a new beginning.[8] Many native multi-day festivals are organised on this occasion all over India.</p>
