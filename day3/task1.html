    <h1>Ramadan</h1><strong></strong>
    <p><b>Ramadan</b><sup>[a]</sup> (<a href="#"> Arabic </a>: رَمَضَان,<a href="#"> romanized</a>:<i> Ramaḍān</i> [ra.ma.dˤaːn];[b] also spelled <b>Ramazan, Ramzan, Ramadhan, or Ramathan</b>) is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, <sup>[8]</sup> observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of <a href="#" >fasting<i>(sawm)</i></a>, <a href="#">prayer <i>(salah)</i></a>, reflection, and community. <sup>[9]</sup> A commemoration of Muhammad's first revelation, <sup>[10]</sup> the annual observance of Ramadan is regarded as one of the <abbr title="KABFIFOUWHOWUFhowf laefhioahtewosfhwf oieafhawoifh">Five Pillars of Islam</abbr> <sup>[11]</sup> and lasts twenty-nine to thirty days, from one sighting of the crescent moon to the next. <sup>[12][13]</sup> </p>

    <p> Fasting from dawn to sunset is obligatory (<a href="#"> fard</a>) for all adult Muslims who are not acutely or chronically ill, travelling, elderly, breastfeeding, diabetic, pregnant, or menstruating. <sup>[14]</sup> The predawn meal is referred to as <a href="#"> <i>suhur </i></a>, and the nightly feast that breaks the fast is called <a href="#"> <i>iftar</i></a>. <sup>[15][16]</sup> Although rulings (<a href="#"> <i>fatawa</i></a>) have been issued declaring that Muslims who live in regions with a midnight sun or polar night should follow the timetable of Mecca,<sup>[17]</sup> it is common practice to follow the timetable of the closest country in which night can be distinguished from day. <sup>[18][19][20]</sup> </p>
    
    <p> The spiritual rewards ( <a href="#"><i>thawab</i></a> ) of fasting are believed to be multiplied during Ramadan. <sup>[21]</sup> Accordingly, during the hours of fasting, Muslims refrain not only from food and drink, but also tobacco products, sexual relations, and sinful behavior, <sup>[22][23]</sup> devoting themselves instead to prayer and study of the Quran. <sup>[24][25]</sup> </p>
